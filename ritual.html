I met Jessie Sparkles in January of 2014. I have seen him for a total of about twelve hours, and, boy, every hour, every minute counted and was, frankly, transformational for me. I contacted Jessie because I had a vague inclination to try BDSM, not really quite understanding where this urge was coming from. From the start, in our exchange of e-mails, he was clear and genial but also serious. That tone has continued in all four sessions. He is consistently knowledgeable and skilled and safe as a Dominant and teacher to this newcomer to the BDSM scene. Explaining, but not too much, so that I learned from direct experience, calibrated to be challenging, but always with the chance for me to pause when needed. He encouraged me to be stronger and more adventurous than I thought possible, since I am basically an awkward guy who used to blanch at the thought of physical pain. I welcomed the element of surprise, that , in his thoughtful way, he brought to our varied routines. I felt something close to exaltation in surrendering to his will—which runs counter to my controlling nature.  Not to sound too sappy— since Jessie is always "on message" —but he has a good heart and really enjoys teaching these skills and subjecting me to trials of submission. I am gradually achieving an ability to stand up to certain pain and ritual restraint and humiliation—in fascinating variety. Though there were a few times when I broke down and had to "yellow light" the tough but careful proceedings, I always felt I was in safe and responsive hands.  And I always came out of the sessions feeling a whole lot better about myself. The structured sessions tapped into something profound in the essence of being a man. He is very good looking and sometimes he shares a glimpse of his impish good humor, and occasionally he touches me with some extraordinary gentleness—a reward for my endurance. I specifically asked that Watersports be part of our play routine and he has obliged in very creative & sensitive ways—another reward in the way of total submission. His bondage technique is expert. Now, I am literally learning the ropes. His command of all manner of whips and floggers is inspiring. He is physically very strong—more than his slight build would suggest—and has a handsome, toned, muscular body. A yoga trained swimmers physique—or rather more than that, as in an ideal  mountain climber. Wrestling was exhilarating; I always lose, which is fine with me. Bright eyes and a lovely smile help me to relax during the intermissions. Same goes for his sound, professional manners. An adroit, agile man I can trust. Always there for me as a considerate teacher and play partner. And, wow, so very hot.
