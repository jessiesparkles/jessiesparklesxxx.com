      <div class="modal-body">
        <p> Recently I was having a 24 hour long funfest with <a href="https://www.tnaboard.com/member.php?124526-nerdybirdy"> Ayna </a> and <a href="https://www.tnaboard.com/member.php?193059-Opal"> Opal </a>, which will be the subject of another upcoming review. The three of us were having a fabulous time, communicating freely about our kinks and special interests, and doing much experimentation. Nuru sandwiches. Tentacle porn. Muffing demonstrations. Taoist sex-magik. The usual mundane stuff that amuses us.</p>

        <p>Ayna suggested at one point when we were all trying to come up with The Next Fun Thing that we should drop a note to Jessie Sparkles, a Seattle-based pro leather top/BDSM/fetish specialist that she had played with in the past, and see if he could drop by for a couple of hours to spice things up even more. We all agreed without hesitation that this sounded like a super idea, and then we contacted him on fairly short notice, and explained our handful of brainstormed ideas for scenes.</p>

        <p>It was very easy to make the arrangements. And the anticipation of his arrival was a bit delicious for everyone, sort of like being offered a shopping spree in a candy store.</p>

        <p>He arrived on time at the appointed hour, to find the three of us already amusing ourselves. We all paused for a few minutes, made introductions, and discussed a couple of the ideas, and our various boundaries. He brought a small selection of his favorite gear in case we were undersupplied - however when he walked into our play room he muttered "what the heck is this, the Altar of Sex?".... I do like prepared people though, well played Jessie.</p>

        <p>And it was off to the races. For the next few hours it was a blur of some pretty primal, slutty, and kinky fun. I'm not sure at any given moment which of us was howling in glee, but it was basically continuous. The energy of the four of us kept feeding on itself and pushing us to new levels of debauched fun.</p>

        <p>Jessie has a quick wit, a disarming personality, the body of a rock climber, great technical and communications skills, and made me feel completely safe in the activities we leapt into - often some I don't do with people I don't know quite well. He went nicely with the flow, and directed the scene and the transitions very well, which was a blessing as the other three of us had been playing nearly non-stop for almost an entire day before he arrived, and were a bit addlepated. At one point near the end though I felt we had lured him over under false pretenses, as the three of us preyed upon him...</p>

        <p>When we were done, we all huddled up in a big exhausted pile and had a nice chat for some time. </p>

        <p>He's a top, but doesn't exude the repulsive-to-me "I'm Lord Domly Dom, fear me!" vibe, it's more an aura of calm competence and reality-based confidence in his skills and abilities, which worked very well with the people in that room that day, inspiring ease and openness in us all. He was also always very attentive to the safety and limits of the people in our scenes. He was superb at changing course based on observing the reactions of his playmates, to keep things fun for all and the activity moving along.</p>

        <p>I'd feel quite comfortable after this meeting engaging with him for other more serious activities, and I have high standards. He's a great guy, and worth calling up if his specialties are within your interests. He also has a nice incall location with a superb dungeon and All The Gear as well.</p>

        <p>I had an amazingly fun time, as did all present. Two thumbs up.</p>

        <p>I found Jessie online after a move across country left me without a Dominant. I needed a queer provider to keep me in line while I sought out a new lifestyle dynamic.  Jessie was a wonderful find in all respects- communicative, professional and hot as hell. All of these things make Jessie an excellent provider. He is incredibly responsive to emails, making it easy to schedule with him. His professionalism extends to sessions- he provides the services he commits to, and is wholly present and available during dates. He is generous with his time and energy, and I never once felt like he was watching the clock. It was a delight to serve a Top as appreciative and available as Jessie- something I’ve found exceedingly rare and hard to find in my 10 years of experience.</p>

 
        <p>Physically, Jessie is stunning. Sinewy arms flex as he leans against the chair, looking down at you on the floor. Blond hair trimmed close, highlighting an angular jawline and a ready smile. His piercing eyes demand attention, and his lean and muscular body will satisfy any latent athletic fetishes you might have. Jessie is a reformed punk who still has all the right edges, and I was delighted to find that he was hotter in person than even his gorgeous pictures might suggest.</p>
 
        <p>In terms of play: I asked to serve Jessie, and he provided a variety of fun and creative sessions that kept me coming back to him on my knees. Playing with Jessie was a unique opportunity for me to test the waters in financial domination, a fetish that I had fantasized about for years, but never had the opportunity to explore in my lifestyle relationships.  I think that is what I like the most about seeing professionals- you can ask for what you want without fear of judgment, and try new things that may not be easy to get in the context of a lifestyle dynamic. Needless to say, I had a fantastic time exploring my fantasies and going places my submission hadn’t taken me in the past.  Translating fantasy to reality is always challenging, but Jessie facilitated our sessions in a way that allowed me to break through my thought barriers and get ankles deep in one of my most untouched fantasies.</p>
 
        <p>In short, being with Jessie allowed me to take the time I needed for a healthy transition between Dominant partners. He was everything I had hoped for in a provider, and I’d recommend him to anyone who is looking for a queer/trans friendly BDSM pro in the Pacific NW.</p>

I met Jessie Sparkles in January of 2014. I have seen him for a total of about twelve hours, and, boy, every hour, every minute counted and was, frankly, transformational for me. I contacted Jessie because I had a vague inclination to try BDSM, not really quite understanding where this urge was coming from. From the start, in our exchange of e-mails, he was clear and genial but also serious. That tone has continued in all four sessions.</p>

<p>He is consistently knowledgeable and skilled and safe as a Dominant and teacher to this newcomer to the BDSM scene. Explaining, but not too much, so that I learned from direct experience, calibrated to be challenging, but always with the chance for me to pause when needed. He encouraged me to be stronger and more adventurous than I thought possible, since I am basically an awkward guy who used to blanch at the thought of physical pain. I welcomed the element of surprise, that , in his thoughtful way, he brought to our varied routines. I felt something close to exaltation in surrendering to his will—which runs counter to my controlling nature.  Not to sound too sappy— since Jessie is always "on message" —but he has a good heart and really enjoys teaching these skills and subjecting me to trials of submission. I am gradually achieving an ability to stand up to certain pain and ritual restraint and humiliation—in fascinating variety. Though there were a few times when I broke down and had to "yellow light" the tough but careful proceedings, I always felt I was in safe and responsive hands.  And I always came out of the sessions feeling a whole lot better about myself. </p>

<p>The structured sessions tapped into something profound in the essence of being a man. He is very good looking and sometimes he shares a glimpse of his impish good humor, and occasionally he touches me with some extraordinary gentleness—a reward for my endurance. I specifically asked that Watersports be part of our play routine and he has obliged in very creative & sensitive ways—another reward in the way of total submission. His bondage technique is expert. Now, I am literally learning the ropes. His command of all manner of whips and floggers is inspiring. He is physically very strong—more than his slight build would suggest—and has a handsome, toned, muscular body. A yoga trained swimmers physique—or rather more than that, as in an ideal  mountain climber. Wrestling was exhilarating; I always lose, which is fine with me. Bright eyes and a lovely smile help me to relax during the intermissions. Same goes for his sound, professional manners. An adroit, agile man I can trust. Always there for me as a considerate teacher and play partner. And, wow, so very hot.
