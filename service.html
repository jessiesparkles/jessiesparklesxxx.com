 I found Jessie online after a move across country left me without a Dominant. I needed a queer provider to keep me in line while I sought out a new lifestyle dynamic.  Jessie was a wonderful find in all respects- communicative, professional and hot as hell. All of these things make Jessie an excellent provider. He is incredibly responsive to emails, making it easy to schedule with him. His professionalism extends to sessions- he provides the services he commits to, and is wholly present and available during dates. He is generous with his time and energy, and I never once felt like he was watching the clock. It was a delight to serve a Top as appreciative and available as Jessie- something I’ve found exceedingly rare and hard to find in my 10 years of experience.
 
Physically, Jessie is stunning. Sinewy arms flex as he leans against the chair, looking down at you on the floor. Blond hair trimmed close, highlighting an angular jawline and a ready smile. His piercing eyes demand attention, and his lean and muscular body will satisfy any latent athletic fetishes you might have. Jessie is a reformed punk who still has all the right edges, and I was delighted to find that he was hotter in person than even his gorgeous pictures might suggest.
 
In terms of play: I asked to serve Jessie, and he provided a variety of fun and creative sessions that kept me coming back to him on my knees. Playing with Jessie was a unique opportunity for me to test the waters in financial domination, a fetish that I had fantasized about for years, but never had the opportunity to explore in my lifestyle relationships.  I think that is what I like the most about seeing professionals- you can ask for what you want without fear of judgment, and try new things that may not be easy to get in the context of a lifestyle dynamic. Needless to say, I had a fantastic time exploring my fantasies and going places my submission hadn’t taken me in the past.  Translating fantasy to reality is always challenging, but Jessie facilitated our sessions in a way that allowed me to break through my thought barriers and get ankles deep in one of my most untouched fantasies.
 
In short, being with Jessie allowed me to take the time I needed for a healthy transition between Dominant partners. He was everything I had hoped for in a provider, and I’d recommend him to anyone who is looking for a queer/trans friendly BDSM pro in the Pacific NW.
