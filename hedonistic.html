<p> Recently I was having a 24 hour long funfest with Ayna ( https://www.tnaboard.com/member.php?124526-nerdybirdy ) and Opal ( https://www.tnaboard.com/member.php?193059-Opal ), which will be the subject of another upcoming review. The three of us were having a fabulous time, communicating freely about our kinks and special interests, and doing much experimentation. Nuru sandwiches. Tentacle porn. Muffing demonstrations. Taoist sex-magik. The usual mundane stuff that amuses us.

Ayna suggested at one point when we were all trying to come up with The Next Fun Thing that we should drop a note to Jessie Sparkles, a Seattle-based pro leather top/BDSM/fetish specialist that she had played with in the past, and see if he could drop by for a couple of hours to spice things up even more. We all agreed without hesitation that this sounded like a super idea, and then we contacted him on fairly short notice, and explained our handful of brainstormed ideas for scenes.

It was very easy to make the arrangements. And the anticipation of his arrival was a bit delicious for everyone, sort of like being offered a shopping spree in a candy store :-)

He arrived on time at the appointed hour, to find the three of us already amusing ourselves. We all paused for a few minutes, made introductions, and discussed a couple of the ideas, and our various boundaries. He brought a small selection of his favorite gear in case we were undersupplied - however when he walked into our play room he muttered "what the heck is this, the Altar of Sex?".... I do like prepared people though, well played Jessie.

And it was off to the races. For the next few hours it was a blur of some pretty primal, slutty, and kinky fun. I'm not sure at any given moment which of us was howling in glee, but it was basically continuous. The energy of the four of us kept feeding on itself and pushing us to new levels of debauched fun.

Jessie has a quick wit, a disarming personality, the body of a rock climber, great technical and communications skills, and made me feel completely safe in the activities we leapt into - often some I don't do with people I don't know quite well. He went nicely with the flow, and directed the scene and the transitions very well, which was a blessing as the other three of us had been playing nearly non-stop for almost an entire day before he arrived, and were a bit addlepated. At one point near the end though I felt we had lured him over under false pretenses, as the three of us preyed upon him...

When we were done, we all huddled up in a big exhausted pile and had a nice chat for some time. 

He's a top, but doesn't exude the repulsive-to-me "I'm Lord Domly Dom, fear me!" vibe, it's more an aura of calm competence and reality-based confidence in his skills and abilities, which worked very well with the people in that room that day, inspiring ease and openness in us all. He was also always very attentive to the safety and limits of the people in our scenes. He was superb at changing course based on observing the reactions of his playmates, to keep things fun for all and the activity moving along.

I'd feel quite comfortable after this meeting engaging with him for other more serious activities, and I have high standards. He's a great guy, and worth calling up if his specialties are within your interests. He also has a nice incall location with a superb dungeon and All The Gear as well.

I had an amazingly fun time, as did all present. Two thumbs up.</p>
